Hey Sarah,

The choice of plot was good and it was easy to understand the information you were trying to portray. You've already made several references to some of the changes you could make and I agree with them.  but rearranging it so in the order of green, yellow, then red would be best. Outside of that I believe your data represents your dataset very well.

Hi Prince, you missed a glaring issue with this plot: the color scale! Red and Green is a no-no as it is undistinguishable for the people with the most common kind of color blindness.
