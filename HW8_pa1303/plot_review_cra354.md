Hi Prince, 

I think your plot clearly shows the positive relationship between reading and math SAT scores and that there are a few schools that do quite well on both sections of the test.  It would be helpful to have a legend showing reference circle sizes for student populations.  Also giving the circles some transparency would help tell them apart in the clustering around (400, 400) 

The limits on the x and y axes and the sizing of the circles are appropriate and honest for representing the scores and test takers.  For your caption I think you should change "number of students in the school" to "number of test takers" since I believe for most schools the SAT is optional and also reverse the order of "Reading vs Math" so that it's Y-axis vs X-axis in order.  The axes labels and plot title could also be larger.

You plot's esthetics are clean and not distracting at all.  From a glance it is easy to tell what you are showing in the data.
